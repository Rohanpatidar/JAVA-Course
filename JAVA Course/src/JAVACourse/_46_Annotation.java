/**
 * The _46_Annotation class provides an illustration of how annotations
 * can be used in a Java program.
 * <p>
 * Annotations in Java are metadata that provide additional information
 * about the program but do not directly affect the program execution.
 * They are widely used in frameworks and libraries to enable various
 * functionalities such as configuration, validation, and code generation.
 * <p>
 * This class serves as a foundation to explore the syntax and implementation
 * of annotations. It can be extended to include examples or demonstrations
 * of custom annotations or usage of predefined annotations in Java.
