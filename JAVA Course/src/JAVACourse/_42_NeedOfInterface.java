/**
 * The _42_NeedOfInterface class serves as an entry point for demonstrating the utility
 * and conceptual need of interfaces in Java. Interfaces are a fundamental part of
 * Java programming, enabling abstraction and multiple inheritance.
 * <p>
 * This class typically illustrates scenarios where interfaces facilitate:
 * - Establishing a contract for classes to implement specific methods.
 * - Supporting the development of pluggable and interchangeable components.
 * - Enforcing consistent behavior across classes without dictating their structure.
 * <p>
 * The primary focus of this class is on showcasing how interfaces address design challenges
 * in building extensible and maintainable applications. Concrete examples or implementations
 * are not included within this class itself but should be considered elsewhere.
