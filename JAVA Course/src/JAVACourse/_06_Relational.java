/**
 * The _06_Relational class demonstrates the use of relational operators in Java.
 * Relational operators are used to compare two values or expressions.
 * <p>
 * The following operators are used:
 * - `<` : Less than
 * - `>` : Greater than
 * - `==` : Equal to
 * - `!=` : Not equal to
 * - `<=` : Less than or equal to
 * - `>=` : Greater than or equal to
 * <p>
 * Relational operators return a boolean result, indicating whether the specified condition is true or false.
 * The code includes commented examples of using these operators with integer values for comparison.
 * These operators are commonly used in conditional statements and loops.
