 * The _38_AbstractDatatype class serves as a placeholder for demonstrating the concept of abstract data types (ADTs) in Java.
 * Abstract data types define a logical data structure and the operations that can be performed on it,
 * without specifying the implementation details.
 * <p>
 * This class does not include specific implementation logic but can be used as a starting point for understanding
 * or developing ADTs such as stacks, queues, or lists.
