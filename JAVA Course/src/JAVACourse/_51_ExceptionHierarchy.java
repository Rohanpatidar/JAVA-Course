/**
 * The _51_ExceptionHierarchy class is intended to demonstrate the concept of exception hierarchy in Java.
 * It highlights the structure and relationships between different exception classes in the Java Exception API.
 * <p>
 * In Java, exceptions are organized in a hierarchical manner, with the root of the exception hierarchy being the
 * `Throwable` class. This class has two primary subclasses: `Error` and `Exception`.
 * <p>
 * The _51_ExceptionHierarchy class may include examples of:
 * - Checked exceptions (subclasses of `Exception`) that must be handled or declared in a method signature.
 * - Unchecked exceptions (subclasses of `RuntimeException`) that do not require explicit handling.
 * - Errors, which are generally caused by serious conditions and are not meant to be caught or handled
 * programmatically.
 * <p>
 * This class serves as a conceptual guide to understanding the Java exception handling mechanism and the
 * relationships between the exception types.
