/**
 * The _07_Logical class demonstrates the use of logical operators in Java.
 * Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions or
 * to reverse the logical state of its operand.
 * <p>
 * This class features examples of the following logical operators:
 * <p>
 * - AND (&&): Returns true if both expressions evaluate to true.
 * - OR (||): Returns true if any of the expressions evaluate to true.
 * - NOT (!): Reverses the logical state of its operand.
 * <p>
 * The class includes commented-out code snippets that illustrate various
 * logical operations based on different conditions involving integer variables.
 * It highlights how logical operators interact with relational expressions.
